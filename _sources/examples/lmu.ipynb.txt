    "Legendre Memory Units (LMUs) are a novel memory cell for recurrent neural networks, described in [Voelker, KajiÄ‡, and Eliasmith (NeurIPS 2019)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9689-legendre-memory-units-continuous-time-representation-in-recurrent-neural-networks.pdf). We will not go into the underlying details of these methods here; for our purposes we can think of this as an alternative to something like LSTMs. LMUs have achieved state of the art performance on complex RNN tasks, which we will demonstrate here. See [the paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9689-legendre-memory-units-continuous-time-representation-in-recurrent-neural-networks.pdf) for all the details!\n",
